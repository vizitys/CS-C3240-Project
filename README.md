## Project for the CS-C3240 Machine Learning course at Aalto University (Autumn 2024), by Veeti Kittamaa and Vinski LÃ¥ng

The main notebook is `asl.ipynb`. Do note that to run the notebook, you need to have a Kaggle API key in a file called `kaggle.json` in the root of the project.

The dataset used is the [ASL Alphabet dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) by Akash Nagaraj.
